	Potato yields were measured for 259 genotypes across four years and four states (MI, NY, OR, WI). A partially replicated design was used, with some genotypes tested using one plot and some with two plots per environment. You are provided an R script illustrating how to analyze the data in ASReml-R using the âEâ model.
	(5 points) For the E model, what is the estimated broad-sense heritability on an entry-mean basis for the replicated entries? Use the arithmetic average of the residual variances across environments.
	(10 points) Analyze using the âLYâ model and report the estimates for G, GxL, GxY, GxLxY, and the mean residual variance. What is the estimated broad-sense heritability on an entry-mean basis for the replicated entries?
	(5 points) Compare results for the E vs LY models. Based on the AIC, which would you select?

	Two traits with equal heritability have a genetic correlation of â0.3. Through selection, your goal is to increase both traits.
	(5 points) Draw the ellipse of possible responses to selection. If certain lengths or angles are known, label them.
	(5 points) What section of the ellipse constitutes the pareto optimal surface?
	(5 points) If the two traits have equal weight for genetic merit, which point on the surface represents the optimal response?

	(10 points) Compute the ratio between the Smith-Hazel index coefficients for two traits that contribute equally to genetic merit, assuming h_1^2=0.2,h_2^2=0.4,r_g=0.3. Assume zero covariance between the prediction errors for the traits, so that r_y=r_g h_1 h_2. 
Hints
	Matrix multiplication in R uses the symbol %*%
	The inverse of matrix A is computed by solve(A)
