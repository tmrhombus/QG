    "        Potato yields were measured for 259 genotypes across four years and four states (MI, NY, OR, WI). A partially replicated design was used, with some genotypes tested using one plot and some with two plots per environment. You are provided an R script illustrating how to analyze the data in ASReml-R using the E model.\n",
    "        (5 points) For the E model, what is the estimated broad-sense heritability on an entry-mean basis for the replicated entries? Use the arithmetic average of the residual variances across environments.\n",
    "        (10 points) Analyze using the VxLY model and report the estimates for G, GxL, GxY, GxLxY, and the mean residual variance. What is the estimated broad-sense heritability on an entry-mean basis for the replicated entries?\n",
